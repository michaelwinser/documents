MVSR Template

The Mission Vision Strategy Roadmap **document** is a living entity that provides a shared understanding to individuals and teams at all levels of the organization, about what a team or project is setting out to achieve. This includes why the mission is valuable for GCP, and a strategy to achieve that mission. 

This document is not a panacea for all communication channels regarding what a team is doing but it is a starting point that should answer a large set of the who, what, why, and how. It should serve as a starting point for creating other documents based on the content here. For example you would not share this with a customer directly but you would use it to inform the creation of a slide that talks about our public facing roadmap or a basis for our engineering plan of record. 

A good MVSR scales the team’s execution by providing a widely and well understood framework for decisions that can be made without you.

The MVSR is a living document. The best MVSR is one that exists, is imperfect, and is continuously updated and refined. The worst MVSR is the one stuck between your ears. It is perfectly normal that the details of a particular decision or feature create an apparent conflict with the MVSR. Resolving that conflict will drive better decisions and improve the MVSR. The document should be updated monthly and reviewed quarterly. One should think of changes to the doc as either clarifications that don’t change the intent or meaningful changes based on external events and observations. Of the four sections, the roadmap will be the most fluid and the mission the more stable foundation. 

*Several users of this template have suggested adding another V: Values. This makes a lot of sense and will likely be added to the template in the future. Feel free to add your own.*

**Please keep the doc to well under 10 pages.**

# Open Issues

During a commenting period there will be issues that are hard to resolve. Rather than hard to manage and lingering comment threads, leads should add sections under “Open Issues” with context, the decision to be made and who should be involved. These can then be spun off into separate meetings or discussed during the leads review.

# Mission

A short, impactful statement that captures what we do.  For example, the Google Cloud Mission Statement is:

*Our mission at Google Cloud is to enable organizations around the world to transform their business using digital technology and to do so by offering the best infrastructure, a digital transformation platform and industry-specific solutions to help you transform your organization as well as to infuse you with our expertise and our culture to help you create that magic.* 

 Another remarkably good example is the mission of the starship Enterprise:

*Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before.*

A mission statement is a broad statement of purpose. Why is this group together? The mission should speak to the problem more than the solution. The purpose of the starship Enterprise is solving the interesting problem of “what’s out there?” 

A mission should also make it easy to understand the scope of the mission, more so than the specifics. The starship Enterprise does not have a mission of ferrying fuel and food to distant outposts. Cloud Build will not drive GCP success as a new compute platform. Your mission should be a refinement of, and reasonably connected to the parent organization’s mission. However it’s impractical to explain how in the mission statement. Do that in strategy.

# Vision

An aspirational view of the future we seek to create 2-5 years. For example, 

Example citation here

If the Mission statement is in the problem domain, the Vision statement is in the solution domain. The vision shows the features and capabilities of the solution and how customers will use them. In broad terms, the vision describes what success looks like.

# Strategy

If mission describes why we are here, and vision describes where we are going, strategy describes how we’re going to get there. Strategy combines context, analysis, priorities, and goals.

## Context

This is the world as it exists today. It should be factual and realistic. It is the ground truth that anchors strategic decisions moving forward. Why does it make sense to do this? Market research, Customer needs, friction reduction etc etc. What value are we providing for Google? 

## Analysis

Analysis seeks to understand the world today and to create hypotheses about where the world is going. 

## Objectives

State your goals. The business outcomes you are trying to achieve.

## Priorities and Choices

Strategy is about making choices. There are many ways you *could* move towards your objectives. Explain the choices you are making and why.

Example: 

Custom Workers is our top priority because:

* Access to on-prep resources via VPC is a top enterprise blocker  
* Enterprise customers want custom machine types and larger pool sizes.  
* Support for VPC-SC is a top enterprise blocker  
* Internal stakeholders also require VPC-SC for their own compliance  
  Custom Workers will enable all of these scenarios and more.

# Roadmap

An 18-24 month overview of internal and external milestones executing on the strategy outlined above. This roadmap is not a schedule commitment. It shows how the big problems of the strategy will be decomposed into manageable steps and how they come together.
